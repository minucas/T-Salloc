# TSRA

This project is a part of my PhD research. Three Time-Sensitive VM provisioning and resource allocation techniques for clouds are implemented along with an existing one (GVMPAC) to compare their performances. They are greedy algorithms and best suited for heavily loaded cloud with heterogeneous resources. The allocation mechanisms are:

1. Earlieast Deadline First (EDF) Allocation
2. Time-Sensitive Resource (TSR) Allocation
3. K-Earlieast Deadline First (K-EDF) Allocation
4. GVMPAC Allocation
